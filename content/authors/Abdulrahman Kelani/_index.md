__A little bit more info__

Rahman got his Master's in Microbiology in the laboratory of Prof. Axel A. Brakhage at the Leibniz Institue for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology: Hans Kn√∂ll Institute. For his PhD studies, Rahman investigates how fungi use RNA interference machinery to control stress response and virulence cascades.
