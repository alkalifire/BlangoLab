Fungi are a major source of human morbidity and mortality, yet diagnosis and treatment both remain challenging. New therapeutic and diagnostic options are urgently needed to combat the increased occurrence of antifungal resistance and the lengthy time to diagnosis. Learn more at [Gaffi](https://www.gaffi.org/).

The Junior Research Group **R**NA **B**iology of Fungal **I**nfections [(RBI)](https://twitter.com/mgblango) at the [Leibniz-HKI](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html) and graciously funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [(BMBF)](www.bmbf.de) aims to close the gap between basic and translational research through an interdisciplinary research program focused on understanding fungal pathogenesis through the lens of RNA biology. It has previously been shown that numerous RNAs have an influence on the biology of infections caused by fungi. We are particularly interested in the detection of RNA populations in host extracellular vesicles that are produced in response to an infection and that can serve as possible diagnostic markers. In addition, we are working to advance our understanding of fungal non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins to facilitate the advancement of new targets for RNA-based therapeutics. 

The recent development of RNA-based therapeutic agents for the treatment of genetic disorders, viral infections, and plant fungal infections all provide convincing examples of the potential of RNA-based therapeutic agents against human fungal infections. New approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections will ultimately improve our understanding of fungal pathogenesis, open up new ways of treatment and diagnosis, and benefit society directly.

**Most importantly**, we are dedicated to providing a rigorous, inclusive, diverse training enviroment for the next generation of budding scientists. In order to facilitate training, we also hope to be able to collaborate widely in the research community. Get in touch if you are interested in setting up a shared lab meeting or pitching a collaborative project!
